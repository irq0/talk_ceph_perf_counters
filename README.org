** Perf Counter Browser
See [[./perf-counter-browser]] for a web-based performance counter schema
browser. It needs to connect to a running Ceph cluster to fetch
performance counter schema from all running daemons. Additional paths
to admin sockets can be specified as arguments to include clients like
RGW.

Counter /groups/ are determined by a heuristic (see: =logger_to_group()=)
from the /logger/ name. The logger usually gets some number or name
appended if more than one is exported.
